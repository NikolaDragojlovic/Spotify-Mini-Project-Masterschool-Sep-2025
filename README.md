# Spotify-Mini-Project-Masterschool-Sep-2025

## Overview 
Mini-project developed during the Masterschool DA & BI Track.
A complete BI solution for Spotify based on historical financial and user data (2017–2025).
The project analyzes revenue streams, user growth, and operational costs to support strategic decisions for three key stakeholders.
I built stakeholder-focused Tableau dashboards that transform complex business metrics into clear, actionable insights for leadership.

## Business Problem

Spotify operates a freemium model, balancing:
Premium subscriptions
Ad-supported users
High content and operational costs;

Leadership needs to understand:
How user growth is evolving
Which revenue streams drive profitability
Where costs can be optimized without harming user experience.

## Project Goals

Explore and clean Spotify's performance dataset.
Identify key trends in revenue, user growth (MAUs), and costs.
Create dedicated Tableau dashboards tailored to each stakeholder's needs.
Provide actionable insights and recommendations


## Stakeholder-Driven Approach

The project is structured around three core personas, each with a dedicated dashboard:

### Sarah – Head of Strategy

Goal: Understand long-term growth and user dynamics
Dashboard: Strategic Growth Overview

Key insights delivered:

Total, Premium, and Ad MAU growth trends

Premium conversion rate (Premium share of MAUs)

Profitability comparison between Premium and Ad segments

### Mark – Director of Revenue

Goal: Optimize monetization and ARPU
Dashboard: Revenue Optimization

Key insights delivered:

Revenue and profit trends by stream (Premium vs Ad)

Premium ARPU evolution vs target

Estimated incremental annual revenue from ARPU uplift

### Olivia – VP of Operations

Goal: Improve cost efficiency and unit economics
Dashboard: Operational Efficiency

Key insights delivered:

Cost structure breakdown (CoR, S&M, R&D, G&A)

Cost per MAU by segment

Gross margin and Cost of Revenue as % of revenue

## How to Read the Dashboards – Metrics & Definitions

Each dashboard is designed to support a specific stakeholder (Sarah, Mark, or Olivia).
Below is a brief explanation of the key metrics and how to interpret them.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

MAU (Monthly Active Users)
Total number of active users (Premium + Ad-supported) in a given month.
A user is considered active if they had at least one listening session in the last 30 days.

Premium MAU
Active users with an active Premium subscription.

Ad-Supported MAU
Active users using the free, ad-supported version of Spotify.

Conversion Rate
Share of Premium MAUs within total MAUs.
Indicates how effectively Spotify converts active users into paying subscribers.

### Revenue Metrics

Total Revenue
Combined revenue from Premium subscriptions and advertising.

Premium Revenue
Revenue generated from paid subscriptions.

Ad Revenue
Revenue generated from advertising on the free tier.

Gross Profit
Revenue minus Cost of Revenue (CoR).
Represents profitability before operating expenses.

ARPU (Average Revenue Per User)
Average revenue generated per active user.
Calculated as Total Revenue / MAUs.
A target line on the chart represents the desired ARPU level.

### Costs & Efficiency

Cost of Revenue (CoR)
Direct costs required to deliver the service (content licensing, infrastructure, payment processing).

Sales & Marketing (S&M)
Costs related to user acquisition and retention.

Research & Development (R&D)
Expenses related to product development and innovation.

General & Administrative (G&A)
Overhead and administrative costs.

Cost per MAU
Average operational cost per active user.
Used to evaluate cost efficiency and scalability.

Gross Margin
Percentage of revenue remaining after subtracting Cost of Revenue.
Indicates how efficiently revenue is converted into gross profit.
